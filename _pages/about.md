I am a mathematics graduate student at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, advised by [Professor Matthew Baker](https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home/). My academic email is [apomeranz3@gatech.edu](mailto:apomeranz3@gatech.edu), feel free to reach out for any inquiries.

### Research
My research interests center on **matroid theory**, with a particular focus on discrete polymatroids and their associated algebraic structures. Specifically, I work with:
* **Representations over tracts**
* **Lorentzian polynomials**
* **Structural properties of polymatroids**

Aside from formal research, I maintain an expository blog where I write about foundational material. My goal is to create a resource that helps students and researchers navigate the complexities of polymatroids in a more elementary way.

### Non-mathematics
I really enjoy homemade baked goods, I have probably made banana bread over 200 times. I like weightlifting. I also am interested in personal finance and investments.
