I am a mathematics graduate student at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, advised by [Professor Matthew Baker](https://sites.google.com/view/mattbakermath/home/). 

### Research
My research interests center on **matroid theory**, with a particular focus on discrete polymatroids and their associated algebraic structures. Specifically, I work with:
* **Representations over tracts**
* **Lorentzian polynomials**
* **Structural properties of polymatroids**

Aside from formal research, I maintain an expository blog where I write about foundational material. My goal is to create a resource that helps students and researchers navigate the complexities of polymatroids in a more elementary way.

### Non-mathematics
Beyond mathematics, I spend much of my time weightlifting and baking—a passion I’ve had since the age of five, specifically for banana bread. I am also interested in personal finance and investments.
